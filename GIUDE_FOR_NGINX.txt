cd ~
Bash
Then download the script. (You should change the link below to the most updated version found on the VIM Scripts site)

wget -O nginx.vim http://www.vim.org/scripts/download_script.php\?src_id\=19394
Bash
downloaded

Then make a syntax directory for vim, if you don't already have it.

mkdir -p ~/.vim/syntax
Bash
Then move the vim file into the correct directory:

mv nginx.vim ~/.vim/syntax/
Bash
Then create your vim filetype file and link the new syntax:

vim ~/.vim/filetype.vim
Bash
and paste in there:

au BufRead,BufNewFile /etc/nginx/*,/usr/local/nginx/conf/* if &ft == '' | setfiletype nginx | endif
vim
You should adjust the path to your nginx config, if it is different than /etc/nginx/.
