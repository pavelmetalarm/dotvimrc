# My .vimrc file , quite simple , very useful for most users 
# When i get into some host and see pretty .vimrc, I just steal it (or a part of it) , doing :


user@host:   git clone "this repo"
user@host:   cat .vimc_from_host >> .vimrc_from_repo 
user@host:   git commit -a 
user@host:   git push


By the way.. there is a problem with a garbage . Need to add only new string (need to "diff").. How?
